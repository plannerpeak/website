## L'Chadash Innovation Challenge 2020
### Company Information
#### Names: Jeremy Wizenfeld, Coby Karben, Israel Gootin, Arshia Kohanteb
#### Company Name: (Tentative) Planner Peak
      	
## Company Description
#### Our app creates a school planner platform which incorporates personalized study schedules, a variety of note taking features, and user based studying skills based on the individual's classes, assignments, and data of assignment length and difficulty. Our app uses the data received into a Machine Learning program which creates a recommended time for finishing an assignment, interactive study methods for a test, and the best note-taking strategies for the user. The app also takes into account any standardized testing from AP exams to SAT and ACT allowing for even more accurate data. The schedule will also adapt to the user’s personal schedule in order to avoid conflict and maximize time.
 
## Target Audience
#### Our first target audience in this endeavor are primarily high school and college students as this app will aid them in their studies allowing for increased learning experience and improvement of grades in a pivotal time in their academic growth. As the company scales, this app will eventually be marketed towards school districts which will dramatically increase the user experience as it will connect and receive data from their schools’ current L.M.S. (learning management system) such as Powerschool Learning and Schoology. 
 
## Distinctions with Competitors
#### There are two main distinctions between our app and all the other competitors. While most of the other apps focus on mainly adding assignments by class and reminding the user to complete their assignment, we will incorporate different methods to take notes, study, generate schedules, and a lot more helpful features which our competitors lack. The main distinction however comes from the use of machine learning. The app will learn the users study habits and average time for completing assignments in order to generate a personalized schedule to help maximize the studying experience. 
 
## Sales & Marketing
#### Planner Peak has 3 potential revenue strategies once the service is complete.
#### Strategy A: This revenue strategy is very similar to PowerSchool and other L.M.S where the district or school pays a lump annually and the students receive the service for free.
#### Strategy B: This would be a freemium revenue model where the base features would be free (either for everyone or for students with .edu accounts) and the additional features that we are working on implementing would be an additional cost.
#### Strategy C: This would be a monthly charge per account (possible discount for .edu emails), and future add-ons would be included in this fee.
